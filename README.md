## Historical Oregon State Highway Maps
_Created by Nicholas Cramer_

A georeferencing project which digitizes and compares historical highway maps created by the Oregon State Highway Commission and the Oregon Department of Transportation. Uses a time slider to quickly observe changes in cartographic techniques and printing technology across the decades.

There are a total of 80 maps on display, dating from 1918-2007. Some years are not included. The full collection can be viewed on [Oregon Digital](https://oregondigital.org/collections/0p0968191?locale=en).
